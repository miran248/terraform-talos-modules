# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues and specs live in GitHub Issues for
miran248/terraform-talos-modules. Use the gh CLI from this repo.

## Conventions

- Create: gh issue create --title "..." --body-file <file>
- Read: gh issue view <number> --comments
- List: gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels
- Comment: gh issue comment <number> --body-file <file>
- Label: gh issue edit <number> --add-label "<label>"
- Remove label: gh issue edit <number> --remove-label "<label>"
- Close: gh issue close <number>

Use a temporary file for multiline bodies. Read labels and comments
when fetching a ticket.

When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker", create a GitHub issue.
When it says "fetch the relevant ticket", read the issue and its comments.
